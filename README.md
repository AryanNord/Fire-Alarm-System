Flame sensor module has a photodiode to detect the light and an op-amp to control the sensitivity. It is used to detect fire and provide a HIGH signal upon the detection. Arduino reads the signal and provides alert by turning on the buzzer and LED.
Components Required-
1. Flame Sensor 
2. Arduino UNO 
3. Jumper Cables (All) 
4. Breadboard Small 
5. Breadboard Big
6. Micro Buzzer
